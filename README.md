## Requirements

      `https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/toppodcasts/limit=100/genre=1310/json`
- [ ] The list results should be cached for 1 day to not make the API call again while cached.

## Stack

Following the previous guidelines and making some assumptions and opinions, I decide to choose the next stack for the development:

- **Webpack**: for not using a pre-configured bundler and fine-tune this project from the start.
- **TypeScript**: a JavaScript superset to improve development experience and maintainability with types and interfaces.
- **CSS**: only native CSS applying the BEM approach
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: for testing purpouses
- **ESLint & Prettier**: for ensuring code quality, consistency, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Husky**: for run tests, lint and format before a commit to ensure code quality.

I also decided to implement a hexagonal architecture and DDD for better scalability and testable code.
